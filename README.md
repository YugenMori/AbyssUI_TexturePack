##FAQ

###- Buttons are gray or in another color instead of the default, and I don't want this?
###A: Go to the AbyssUI options (/abyssui options) and check "Disable Button Color Text".

###- I don't like the new buttons (white background), what should I do?
###A: There's a folder named "zzBackup", copy the folders inside it, and replace them with the already on the interface folder.
